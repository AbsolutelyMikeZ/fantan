Fan Tan card game

This my very first Ruby project.  I'm also learning about Git and GitHub with this project.  

The initial version of the game creates the deck of cards, shuffles the deck, and deals out all of the cards to the players.  
Game play starts with the 7 of diamonds, and rotates through the players.  
Each player must either play a 7, build upon the existing cards played, or pay the pot.
The first player to play all of his cards is the winner of the hand and wins the pot.
